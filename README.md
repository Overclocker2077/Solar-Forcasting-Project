Science Fair Research Project

By creating a polynomial regression predictive model, this project aims to provide an AI-based approach to predict the energy output of a solar panel under various conditions. Polynomial regression is a suitable choice because the angle of light, luminous intensity, temperature, and voltage output initially have a direct relationship that follows a linear path but eventually plateau. This project showcases how machine learning can be applied to predict the efficiency of solar panels under different weather conditions and seasons.
